## What is an index token?

##### ❓ An index token is like a basket that holds many different types of cryptocurrencies at once, allowing investors to invest in several cryptocurrencies through one token.

## Inspiration

##### 👻 Fantom network currently does not have any Index Tokens.

##### 🧟 We took inspiration from [TokenSets / Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) and recreated it without any fees.

## What it does

##### 🎃 Lets users create & manage their own index tokens

##### 🧙 Redeem index tokens for underlying assets

##### 🧛‍♂️ Creators can collect a custom streaming fee from 0 to 1% per year

##### 🍬 Others can buy these tokens on a decentralized exchange

##### 🔪 Adjust/rebalance each portion of underlying tokens in an index token

## How we built it

##### 🕯️ Wrote the solidity smart contract from the ground up

##### ✨ Integrated [SpookySwap](https://spooky.fi/#/) for token rebalancing

##### 🧪 Tested by forking Fantom Mainnet using Hardhat

## Challenges we ran into

##### 🧮 Algorithms to transfer a streaming fee from all token holders to the creator

##### 📐 Mathematics for how much to calculate % of underlying tokens

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

##### 🔮 Calculated necessary values to execute trades

##### ⚰️ Successfully Rebasing tokens

##### 👽 Integrating the Smart Contracts & Website together

## What we learned

##### 🧠 Learning more about solidity math

##### 🌃 Learning about the Fantom Ecosystem

## What's next for Pumpkin Index
