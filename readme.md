# 🎃Pumpkin Index 🎃

## What is an index token?

##### ❓ An index token is like a basket that holds many different types of cryptocurrencies at once, allowing investors to invest in several cryptocurrencies through one token.

## Inspiration

##### 👻 Fantom network currently does not have any Index Tokens.

##### 🧟 We took inspiration from [TokenSets / Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) and recreated it without any fees.

## What it does

##### 🎃 Lets users create & manage their own index tokens

##### 🧙 Redeem index tokens for underlying assets

##### 🧛‍♂️ Creators can collect a custom streaming fee from 0 to 1% per year

##### 🍬 Others can buy these tokens on a decentralized exchange

##### 🔪 Adjust/rebalance each portion of underlying tokens in an index token

## How we built it

##### 🕯️ Wrote the solidity smart contract from the ground up

##### ✨ Integrated [SpookySwap](https://spooky.fi/#/) for token rebalancing

##### 🧪 Tested by forking Fantom Mainnet using Hardhat

## What's next for Pumpkin Index

##### 🍂Gas optimization

##### 🐺 Security Auditing
